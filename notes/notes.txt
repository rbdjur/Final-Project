1.  In ConfirmationRoutes.js

originally I had: 

"

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send({ message: "hi"})
    console.log("inside router.get on ConfirmationRoutes.js")
 }).then(function (response) {
     res.send("hi");
     console.log("This is the response" + response)
 }).catch(function (error) {
    console.log("this is the catch error" + error)
});
" 

but an error return stating that the .then() and .catch() were not functions.  So I deleted them and once they were deleted, I ran the code with just the .get(). From there I went to the correct route and successfully established the route using express.

2.  An error occured stating Cannot Get "/".  I couldnt think of why this error occured.  However, I remembered that in order to communicate the ConfirmationRoutes.js page with the server, I must export a variable assigned the ConfirmationRoutes.js page: 

        "const router = require("express").Router();"

After assigning the variable a value, I exported the variable using module exports as follows below: 

        " module.exports = router;"


  Once this variable is exported, I went to server.js page and used the code: 

        "app.use(router);"

The router is the entire ConfirmationRoutes.js page, so once this page is used by express, I was able to draw the codes from ConfirmationRoutes onto the server page.  These codes executed when I went to the correct get route. 

3.  Use reactRouter to serve the front end code on App.js + use week 20 HW exercise 4/5 and videos.

-Downloaded "npm install --save express@4.15.2" for on socket.io website in order to implement the chat feature. Installed in the backend files. 

5. July 31 - 1:30 A

downloaded:
"
    npm install --save socket.io

"

added html and minimal css and html to the current page.  

Right now... trying to implement socket.io, I added some html to the "Inquire" tab under the "Interactive" component.  
- The new form is input, commented out possible alternatives. 

In the index.html page I put the socket.io script tag before the body.  example: 
"
    <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  var socket = io();
</script>
"

In the server.js file, I added 

"
var app = require('express')();
var http = require('http').Server(app);
var io = require('socket.io')(http);
"

Note to self: Comment back some comments outs.  

Before I could get the front end to render, however when the socket.io settings are turned on, the front end cannot render.

Error I receive is :
"
inside router.get on ConfirmationRoutes.js
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/Users/deguzman714/first_day_stuff/Projects/Final-Project/Final-Project./client/src/App.js'

"

Need to work on getting those features of socket.io working, especially the chat box of server.js.
